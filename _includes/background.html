      I have a great passion for performance and human-computer interaction,
      which converge in my interest for compiler technologies. I enjoy
      building foundational solutions, open systems, and developer tools that
      reduce the amount of friction when interfacing with software.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, you'll
      probably find me somewhere cycling, visiting someplace new with my
      partner, or reading sci-fi books. ðŸ“–
